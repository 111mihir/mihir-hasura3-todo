# and the association of namespaces to HML files
# You can create different build profiles for different environments,
# like production and staging, which may reference environment specific auth configs
# We have created one for you to get you started

  - build-profile.yaml

# Default build profile refers to build profile
# that is used when you create a build and don't specify the build profile
